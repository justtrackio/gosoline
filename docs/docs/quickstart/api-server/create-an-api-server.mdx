One of the primary use cases for gosoline is to create a REST web service. In this tutorial, you'll do just that!

Specifically, you'll use gosoline to create a web service that handles a single endpoint:

```http
GET /todo?id={ID}&text={TODO TEXT}
```

This endpoint will:

1. Accept the data from the request's querystring
2. Send a Json response with the `id` and `text` from the request, along with an ISO-formatted creation date and time.

Here's an example response:

```json
{
  "Id": 3,
  "Text": "doit",
  "CreatedAt": "2023-09-05T11:18:09.325852335+02:00"
}
```

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.

## Set up your file structure

First, you need to set up the following file structure:

```txt
todo/
├── handler.go
├── main.go
└── config.dist.yml
```

For example, in Unix, run:

```shell
mkdir todo; cd todo
touch handler.go
touch main.go
touch config.dist.yml
```

Those are all the files you need to build your web service with gosoline! Next, you'll implement each of these files, starting with `handler.go`.

## Implement handler.go

In `handler.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>handler.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `handler.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

```go title=handler.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/apiserver"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/cfg"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/log"
)
```

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` and `time` modules along with three gosoline dependencies:

- `apiserver`
- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Define a Todo

Next, you created a `Todo` struct:

```go title=handler.go
type Todo struct {
	Id        int    `form:"id"`
	Text      string `form:"text"`
	CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

Later in this file, you'll use this to bind the data from the HTTP querystring. Referring back to the specification for your todo service, the expected querystring looks like this:

```http
?id={ID}&text={TODO TEXT}
```

So, in your struct, you have an `Id` and a `Text`. With the `form:` tag, you've specified the querystring parameter from which to pull the value for these keys.

### Create a TodoHandler

Next, you created a struct for handling todos:

```go title=handler.go
type TodoHandler struct {
	logger log.Logger
}
```

This is a simple structure that holds a `log.Logger` reference.

### Get request inputs

Next, you created a function called `GetInput()` that returns the input instance to use:

```go title=handler.go
func (t TodoHandler) GetInput() interface{} {
	return &Todo{}
}
```

This is required because your `TodoHandler` must implement the `GetInput()` method of the `apiserver.HandlerWithInput` interface.

### Handle new todos

Next, you created a function called `NewTodoHandler()`:

```go title=handler.go
func NewTodoHandler(ctx context.Context, config cfg.Config, logger log.Logger) (*TodoHandler, error) {
	handler := &TodoHandler{
		logger: logger,
	}

	return handler, nil
}
```

The `config` and `logger` argument types come from gosoline. This function initializes a new `TodoHandler` and assigns it the `logger`. Then, it returns the handler with no error.

### Handle requests

Finally, you created a `Handle()` function that accepts a `context.Context` and an `apiserver.Request` (also from gosoline) and handles that request:

```go
func (t TodoHandler) Handle(
	ctx context.Context,
	request *apiserver.Request,
) (*apiserver.Response, error) {
	// 1
	todo := request.Body.(*Todo)

	// 2
	todo.CreatedAt = time.Now()

	// 3
	t.logger.Info("got todo with id %d", todo.Id)

	// 4
	return apiserver.NewJsonResponse(todo), nil
}
```

Here, you've implemented a request handler in the following steps:

1. Initialize a `Todo` struct from the request body.
2. Set the `CreatedAt` to now.
3. Log the request using the `TodoHandler` struct's `logger`.
4. Return a Json response object with information from the `Todo` struct.

With gosoline, you can handle requests and responses in just a few lines of code.

`handler.go` contains most of the heavy lifting for your web service. However, you still need a main entry point to your service, where you'll make use of the logic in `handler.go`. This, you'll add in `main.go`.

## Implement main.go

In `main.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>main.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Main}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

In `main.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

```go title=main.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/apiserver"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/application"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/cfg"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/log"
)
```

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` and `time` modules along with three gosoline dependencies:

- `apiserver`
- `application`
- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Create your main entry point

Next, you created your `main()` function as the entry point to your service:

```go title=main.go
func main() {
	// 1
	definer := func(ctx context.Context, config cfg.Config, logger log.Logger) (*apiserver.Definitions, error) {
		// 2
		def := &apiserver.Definitions{}

		// 3
		var err error
		var handler apiserver.HandlerWithInput

		// 4
		if handler, err = NewTodoHandler(ctx, config, logger); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("can not create trip handler: %w", err)
		}

		// 5
		def.GET("/todo", apiserver.CreateQueryHandler(handler))

		// 6
		return def, nil
	}

	// 7
	application.RunApiServer(definer)
}
```

`main()` puts together all the data structures and logic from `handler.go` into a single, coherent function. To better understand this code, you can break it down like this:

1. Initialize `definer`, an API server factory that defines your HTTP route.
2. Initialize `def`, a reference to the `apiserver.Definitions`, which you'll use to create a GET route.
3. Instantiate two new variables for handling errors and request input data.
4. Create a handler (`NewTodoHandler`) that handles the request input data. If there is an error, return an error message. If there is no error, assign this `NewTodoHandler` to the `handler` variable from the last step. 
5. Create a GET route for the endpoint `/todo`, using the `handler`.
6. Return the response from `handler`.
7. Run an API server application based on the logic from the previous steps.

Now, you've implemented your server's main entry point and handler logic. Next, you'll configure your server.

## Configure your server

In `config.dist.yml`, configure your server:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="config.dist.yml">{ConfigDist}</CodeBlock>

Here, you set some minimal configurations for your web server. The final step is to test it to confirm that it works as expected.

## Test your gosoline server

From the `todo` directory, start your go module, install the dependencies, and run your server:

```shell
go mod init todo/m
go mod tidy
go run .
```

In your console, you'll see a log stream that indicates your server is running properly. By default, the server is exposed to localhost:8080.

Make a GET request to `localhost:8080/todo`. For example:

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080/todo?id=1&text=do_it'
```

You'll get the following output:

```shell
{"Id":1,"Text":"do_it","CreatedAt":"2023-09-05T16:55:49.02692+02:00"}
```
