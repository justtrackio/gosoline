import { CodeBlock } from '../../components.jsx';
import ConfigDist from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-an-http-server/config.dist.yml";
import Handler from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-an-http-server/handler.go";
import Main from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-an-http-server/main.go";

One of the primary use cases for Gosoline is to create a REST web service. In this tutorial, you'll do just that!

Specifically, you'll use Gosoline to create a web service that handles a single endpoint:

```http
GET /todo?id={ID}&text={TODO TEXT}
```

This endpoint will:

1. Accept the data from the request's query string
2. Send a JSON response with the `id` and `text` from the request, along with an ISO-formatted creation date and time.

Here's an example response:

```json
{
  "Id": 3,
  "Text": "doit",
  "CreatedAt": "2023-09-05T11:18:09.325852335+02:00"
}
```

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.

## Set up your file structure

First, you need to set up the following file structure:

```txt
todo/
├── handler.go
├── main.go
└── config.dist.yml
```

For example, in Unix, run:

```shell
mkdir todo; cd todo
touch handler.go
touch main.go
touch config.dist.yml
```

Those are all the files you need to build your web service with Gosoline! Next, you'll implement each of these files, starting with `handler.go`.

## Implement handler.go

In `handler.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>handler.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walk through this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `handler.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="imports">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` and `time` modules along with three Gosoline dependencies:

- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Define a `Todo`

Next, you created a `Todo` struct:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="todo struct">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Later in this file, you'll use this to bind the data from the HTTP query string. Referring back to the specification for your `todo` service, the expected query string looks like this:

```http
?id={ID}&text={TODO TEXT}
```

So, in your struct, you have an `Id` and a `Text`. With the `form:` tag, you've specified the query string parameter from which to pull the value for these keys.

### Create a `TodoHandler`

Next, you created a struct for handling `todo` objects:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="todo handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This is a simple structure that holds a `log.Logger` reference.

### Get request inputs

Next, you created a function called `GetInput()` that returns the input instance to use:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="get input">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This is required because your `TodoHandler` must implement the `GetInput()` method of the `httpserver.HandlerWithInput` interface.

### Handle new `todo` objects

Next, you created a function called `NewTodoHandler()`:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="new todo handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

The `config` and `logger` argument types come from Gosoline. This function initializes a new `TodoHandler` and assigns it the `logger`. Then, it returns the handler with no error.

### Handle requests

Finally, you created a `Handle()` function that accepts a `context.Context` and an `httpserver.Request` (also from Gosoline) and handles that request:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="handle">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Here, you handle requests and responses in just a few lines of code. `handler.go` does most of the heavy lifting for your web service. However, you still need a main entry point to your service, where you'll make use of the logic in `handler.go`. This, you'll add in `main.go`.

## Implement main.go

In `main.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>main.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Main}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walk through this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

In `main.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="main.go" snippet="imports">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` and `time` modules along with four Gosoline dependencies:

- `application`
- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Create your main entry point

Next, you created your `main()` function as the entry point to your service:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="main.go" snippet="main">{Main}</CodeBlock>

`main()` puts together all the data structures and logic from `handler.go` into a single, coherent function.

Now, you've implemented your server's main entry point and handler logic. Next, you'll configure your server.

## Configure your server

In `config.dist.yml`, configure your server:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="config.dist.yml">{ConfigDist}</CodeBlock>

Here, you set some minimal configurations for your web server. The final step is to test it to confirm that it works as expected.

## Test your Gosoline server

From the `todo` directory, start your go module, install the dependencies, and run your server:

```shell
go mod init todo/m
go mod tidy
go run .
```

In your console, you'll see a log stream that indicates your server is running properly. By default, the server is exposed to localhost:8080.

Make a GET request to `localhost:8080/todo`. For example:

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080/todo?id=1&text=do_it'
```

You'll get the following output:

```shell
{"Id":1,"Text":"do_it","CreatedAt":"2023-09-05T16:55:49.02692+02:00"}
```
