A common REST API structure provides methods for users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** (CRUD) resources. In this tutorial, you'll:

- Create an HTTP server that provides these CRUD methods
- Implement logic that interfaces with a MySQL backend

Specifically, users of your service will be able create, read, update, and delete `todo` objects, such as you might use for a "To do list".

## Before you begin

While this tutorial requires no prior code, it's an intermediate Gosoline tutorial and, therefore, skips some explanations. To understand the logic in this tutorial, you should have already completed at least one of the following tutorials first:

- [Create an HTTP server](/quickstart/http-server/create-an-http-server)
- [Create a money exchange app](/quickstart/http-server/create-a-money-exchange-app)

This tutorial also assumes you have some basic knowledge about relational databases, such as: 

- Data models
- Primary keys
- Migrations

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine: 

- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Set up your file structure

First, you need to set up the following file structure:

```txt
crud/
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initialize_schema.up.sql
├── docker-compose.yml
├── handler.go
├── config.dist.yml
└── main.go
```

For example, in Unix, run:

```shell
mkdir crud; cd crud
mkdir migrations
touch migrations/1_initialize_schema.up.sql
touch docker-compose.yml
touch handler.go
touch config.dist.yml
touch main.go
```

Those are all the files you need to build your CRUD service with Gosoline! Next, you'll implement each of these files, starting with `handler.go`.

## Implement handler.go

In `handler.go`, add the following code:

<details>

<summary>handler.go</summary>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

</details>

Now, you'll walk through this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `handler.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="imports">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context`, `fmt`, and `time` modules along with several Gosoline dependencies.

### Define your database settings

In this tutorial, you use a MySQL database to manage `todo` records. So, you first defined the settings for the data:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="settings">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

These settings include a model name, table name, and primary key.

### Define your `Todo` struct

Next, you defined a structure to model your `todo` objects:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="todo">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

The `Todo` has three values:

- A [database model](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/blob/9b64c30bc4156d16fb1f2d11930f0b686b5d0113/pkg/db-repo/model.go#L17)
- Some text
- A due date for the `todo`

### Define your input structs

Next, you defined two structures for handling request input:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="create and update">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

When you create a `todo`, you'll pass the `todo` object's text and a due date. When you update a `todo`, you'll pass only the text. Here, you defined the structures for parsing and storing that information.

### Define your `TodoCrudHandler`

Next, you defined a handler for CRUD requests:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="crud handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Here, the handler has a `repo`, which implements the [`Repository`](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/blob/3c9f7b66578c95dca509faa35f653ef16ca12340/pkg/db-repo/repository.go#L55) interface. This `repo` implements model-based methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.

The ["read" method](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/blob/3c9f7b66578c95dca509faa35f653ef16ca12340/pkg/db-repo/repository.go#L44C4-L44C4) is a special case for `repo` because it implements multiple handlers for reading information:

- `Read()`
- `Query()`
- `Count()`
- `GetModelId()`
- `GetModelName()`
- `GetMetadata()`

:::info

The V0 in `TodoCrudHandlerV0` sets up a structure for you to version this handler later.

:::


Later, you implement the methods for this struct.

### Implement a constructor

Next, you implemented a constructor for your `TodoCrudHandlerV0`:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="todo constructor">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

### Implement the methods for your handler

Finally, you implemented the following methods for your `TodoCrudHandlerV0`:

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="get repo">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This returns the handler's repository object.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="get model">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This returns the `Todo` model.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="create input">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This returns the `CreateInput` struct.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="transform create">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This parses the `Text` and `DueDate` from a `CreateInput` object and sets them on a `Todo` model. This is used for Create requests.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="get update input">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This returns the `UpdateInput` struct.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="transform update">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This parses the `Text` from an `UpdateInput` object and sets them on a `Todo` model. This is used for Update requests.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="transform output">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

This simply returns the model with no transformations.

<CodeBlock title="handler.go" language="go" snippet="list">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Now, you've implemented the handlers and logic for a model-based CRUD API. Next, you'll implement a main function that applies this logic.

## Implement main.go

In `main.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>main.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Main}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walk through this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `main.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock title="main.go" language="go" snippet="imports">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` and `fmt` modules along with several Gosoline dependencies.

### Implement main()

Then, you implemented `main()`:

<CodeBlock title="main.go" language="go" snippet="main">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Now that you have all your logic, you'll move on to setting up your server and docker container.

## Configure your server

In `config.dist.yml`, configure your server:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="config.dist.yml">{ConfigDist}</CodeBlock>

Here, you set some minimal configurations for your web server. You also configured your MySQL database, including the migrations you'll run to build a table for your `todo` objects. This migration will live in the migrations directory. You'll add this next.

## Add an initial migration

In `migrations/1_initialize_schema.up.sql`, add a migration that creates a `todos` table:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="sql" title="migrations/1_initialize_schema.up.sql">{Migration}</CodeBlock>

Here, you created a table, called `todos`, with five columns:

1. `id`: The `todo` object's identifier.
2. `text`: The `todo` object's text.
3. `due_date`: The `todo` object's due date.
4. `updated_at`: The last time the `todo` was updated.
5. `created_at`: The time the `todo` was created.

## Configure docker-compose

Next, in docker-compose.yml, add the following configurations:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="docker-compose.yml">{DockerCompose}</CodeBlock>

This sets up docker-compose to create a container running a MySQL server.

## Test your work

Now it's time to test your work and make sure everything you created works properly.

### Start MySQL

First, start your MySQL container:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Now, you have a MySQL database running in a container. You can see it running on port 3306 with `docker ps` in another shell:

```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                               NAMES
ccf507fd70e4   mysql:8.0.31   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   write-crud-sql-app-mysql-1
```

### Run your server

In another shell, navigate to the root `crud` directory of this project and spin up your server:

```shell
go mod init crud/m
go mod tidy
go run .
```

You'll see logs of your server running.

### Make requests

Finally, in a third shell, make requests to your service. For example, create a `todo`:

```shell
curl -d '{"text":"do it!", "dueDate":"2023-09-08T15:00:00Z"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/v0/todo
```

View the `todo`:

```shell
curl -X GET localhost:8080/v0/todo/1
```

Update the `todo`:

```shell
curl -d '{"text":"do it!!!"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT localhost:8080/v0/todo/1
```

View the `todo` again to observe the changes:

```shell
curl -X GET localhost:8080/v0/todo/1
```

List all `todo` objects:

```shell
curl -d '{}' -X POST localhost:8080/v0/todos
```

Delete a `todo`:

```shell
curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/v0/todo/1
```

## Check the database

To verify that everything is working as you expected on the backend, check the database.

First, look up your database container id:

```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                               NAMES
ccf507fd70e4   mysql:8.0.31   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   write-crud-sql-app-mysql-1
```

In this example, the container ID is `ccf507fd70e4`, but it'll be different for you.

Next, log into `mysql` in the container:

```shell
docker exec -it ccf507fd70e4 mysql -u root -p
```

There are two things to note:

- Use your MySQL container ID here instead of `ccf507fd70e4`
- Use the password `gosoline`, as you previously defined in `docker-compose.yml`

From the `mysql` console, change to the `gosoline` database:

```shell
mysql> use gosoline
Database changed
```

Finally, query the `todos` table to see your records:

```shell
mysql> select * from todos;
+----+----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| id | text     | due_date            | updated_at          | created_at          |
+----+----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|  1 | do it!!! | 2023-09-08 15:00:00 | 2023-09-12 09:35:22 | 2023-09-12 09:35:12 |
+----+----------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

If you have no records, you'll need to create one:

```shell
curl -d '{"text":"do it!", "dueDate":"2023-09-08T15:00:00Z"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/v0/todo
```

## Conclusion

And you're done! You've used Gosoline to create a fully-fledged CRUD API service, complete with endpoints for:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
- List

You also used docker to host a MySQL database and used a `Todo` model to handle API inputs and outputs as well as to store data in the table.
