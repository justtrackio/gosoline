One of the primary purposes of Gosoline is to help you build an HTTP server. An HTTP server, in the context of Gosoline, is a module that: 

- Runs indefinitely
- Listens to a port for requests
- Provides responses to those requests

Our [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver) package provides a convenient way to create HTTP servers.

In this tutorial, you'll create a money exchange web service. This service will have two endpoints:

```http
GET /euro/{AMOUNT IN SOURCE CURRENCY}/{SOURCE CURRENCY}
GET /euro-at-date/{AMOUNT IN SOURCE CURRENCY}/{SOURCE CURRENCY}/{EXCHANGE RATE DATE}
```

Both of these endpoints: 

- Accept an amount in a source currency.
- Convert that amount to euros based on an exchange rate.

The `euro-at-date` endpoint allows you to specify a historical date for the exchange rate.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.

## Set up your file structure

First, you need to set up the following file structure:

```txt
money-exchange/
├── handler.go
├── definer.go
├── config.dist.yml
└── main.go
```

For example, in Unix, run:

```shell
mkdir money-exchange; cd money-exchange
touch handler.go
touch definer.go
touch config.dist.yml
touch main.go
```

Those are all the files you need to build your web service with gosoline! Next, you'll implement each of these files, starting with `handler.go`.

## Implement handler.go

In `handler.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>handler.go</summary>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import your dependencies

At the top of `handler.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="imports">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported several standard modules along with four gosoline dependencies:

- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- `currency`
- [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Define a euroHandler structure

Next, you created a `euroHandler` struct:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="euro handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

You'll use this in a few places to carry data about your logger and currency service. You'll also implement its `Handle()` method to handle HTTP requests.

### Define a handler

Then, you implemented a function for creating new `euroHandler` structs:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="new euro handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

You'll use this later to create a new `euroHandler`.

### Implement a request handler

Then, you implemented `euroHandler.Handle()` for handling HTTP requests:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="handle">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

### Define a euroAtDateHandler

Like you did with `euroHandler`, you defined a `euroAtDateHandler` struct and a corresponding constructor:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="euro at date handler">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

The logic here is very similar to the logic for `euroHandler`.

### Implement a second request handler

Finally, you implemented `euroAtDateHandler.Handle()` for handling HTTP requests:

<CodeBlock language="go" title="handler.go" snippet="euro-at-date handler handle">{Handler}</CodeBlock>

The logic here is very similar to the logic for `euroHandler.Handle()`. 

Now, you've fully implemented your request handlers. Next, you'll create a `Definer` object.

## Implement definer.go

In `definer.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>definer.go</summary>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Definer}</CodeBlock>

</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `definer.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock title="definer.go" language="go" snippet="imports">{Definer}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the standard `context` and `fmt` modules along with three gosoline dependencies:

- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)

### Implement a definer

Then, you implemented `ApiDefiner`:

<CodeBlock title="definer.go" language="go" snippet="api definer">{Definer}</CodeBlock>

Here, the `:amount`, `:currency`, etc. constructs are path parameters. This means the handler will be able to access and use them. Indeed, you already implemented this behavior in your `handler.go` file. `euroHandler.Handle()` gets these values like this:

```go
currency := request.Params.ByName("currency")
amountString := request.Params.ByName("amount")
```

Now that you've created handlers and a definer, create a configuration file.

## Configure your server

In `config.dist.yml`, [configure your server](/how-to/configure-your-httpserver):

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="config.dist.yml">{ConfigDist}</CodeBlock>

Here, you set some minimal configurations for your web server. There are a few interesting configurations to note:

- `httpserver.default.port` exposes port 8080. (In your applications, you can configure [more aspects of the server](/reference/package-httpserver#settings) in a similar manner.)
- The `currency` key value store (`kvstore`) is defined as `inMemory` and serves as a local database. The `currency` module that you used in `handler.go` uses this to store the exchange rates for various currencies:
    - First, it makes an initial call to an external endpoint in order to get exchange rates and stores them in a kvstore
    - Later, it occasionally makes more calls to obtain exchange rates, in order to keep the kvstore updated

At this point, you've implemented your handlers, a definer, and your app configuration. Next, you'll implement `main.go` that puts it all together.

## Implement main.go

In `main.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>main.go</summary>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Main}</CodeBlock>

</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import your dependencies

At the top of `main.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

<CodeBlock title="main.go" language="go" snippet="imports">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported three gosoline dependencies:

- `application`
- `currency`
- [`httpserver`](/reference/package-httpserver)

### Implement main()

Then, you implemented the main entry point for your web service:

<CodeBlock title="main.go" language="go" snippet="main">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Here, you run a kernel that uses _config.dist.yml_ for its configuration and uses the `api` and `currency` modules.

:::note 

Notice the `api` module is using your `ApiDefiner` that, in turn, uses your handlers.

:::

Now that you've wired the application up, the final step is to test it to confirm that it works as expected.

## Run your application

Initialize your go module, install the dependencies, and run your web service:

```shell
go mod init money_exchange/m
go mod tidy
go run .
```

In a separate terminal, make requests to your service:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/euro/10/GBP
curl localhost:8080/euro-at-date/10/USD/2021-01-03T00:00:00Z
```

## Conclusion
