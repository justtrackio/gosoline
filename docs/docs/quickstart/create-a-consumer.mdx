title: Create a consumer

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ConfigDist from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-a-consumer/config.dist.yml";
import Consumer from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-a-consumer/consumer.go";
import Main from "!!raw-loader!./src/create-a-consumer/main.go";

One of the primary use cases for gosoline is to create a message queue consumer. In this tutorial, you'll do just that!

To build a consumer of async message queues you'll' implement the `ConsumerCallback` interface of the `stream` package.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.

## Set up your file structure

First, you need to set up the following file structure:

```txt
consumer/
├── consumer.go
├── main.go
├── events.json
└── config.dist.yml
```

For example, in Unix, run:

```shell
mkdir consumer; cd consumer
touch consumer.go
touch main.go
touch events.json
touch config.dist.yml
```

Those are all the files you need to build your first consumer with gosoline! Next, you'll implement each of these files, starting with `consumer.go`.

## Implement consumer.go

In `consumer.go`, add the following code:

<details><summary>consumer.go</summary>
<p>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go">{Consumer}</CodeBlock>

</p>
</details>

Now, you'll walkthrough this file in detail to learn how it works.

### Import dependencies

At the top of `consumer.go`, you declared the package and imported some dependencies:

```go title=consumer.go
package main

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/cfg"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/log"
	"github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/stream"
)
```

Here, you declared the package as `main`. Then, you imported the `context` module along with three gosoline dependencies:

- [`cfg`](/reference/package-cfg)
- [`log`](/reference/package-log)
- `stream`

### Implement your data structs

Then, you created an `Input` struct and a `Consumer` struct:

```go title=consumer.go
// 1
type Input struct {
	Id   string `json:"id"`
	Body string `json:"body"`
}

// 2
type Consumer struct {
	logger log.Logger
}
```

You'll use these to: 

1. Bind data from the message queue. Note that you read an `id` and `body` from Json keys.
2. Store logger information about your consumer.

### Implement `Consumer` methods

Next, you implemented some methods for the `Consumer`:

```go title=consumer.go
// 1
func NewConsumer(ctx context.Context, config cfg.Config, logger log.Logger) (stream.ConsumerCallback, error) {
	return &Consumer{
		logger: logger,
	}, nil
}

// 2
func (c Consumer) GetModel(attributes map[string]interface{}) interface{} {
	return &Input{}
}

// 3
func (c Consumer) Consume(ctx context.Context, model interface{}, attributes map[string]interface{}) (bool, error) {
	input := model.(*Input)

	c.logger.WithContext(ctx).Info("got input with id %q and body %q", input.Id, input.Body)

	return true, nil
}
```

Here, you implemented:

1. A constructor for creating new `Consumer` objects. This implements the `stream.ConsumerCallbackFactory` type and is used to add the callback to your application.
2. `GetModal()`, a method that returns the expected input model struct which is used to unmarshal the
data.
3. `Consume()`, a method that loads the model (`Input`) with data, logs the data, and returns `true` because it successfully handled the message. This is called for every incoming message.

Together, these methods implement the `ConsumerCallback` interface.

## Implement `main.go`

In `main.go`, add the following code:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="go" title="main.go">{Main}</CodeBlock>

Here, you execute your consumer. `RunConsumer()` expects a parameter of the type `stream.ConsumerCallbackFactory` to create and run the consumer. `NewConsumer()` implements this interface.

## Configure your consumer

In `config.dist.yml`, configure your server:

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="yaml" title="config.dist.yml">{ConfigDist}</CodeBlock>

Here, you set some minimal configurations for your web server. By default, the gosoline expects that there is an input configured with the config key `stream.input.consumer`. This defines the input source. In this tutorial, you'll use a file as source with the configured filename, "events.json".

## Add your data

In `events.json`, add some mock events stream data:

```json
{"body": "{\"id\": \"1a0a960f-f04f-4c41-9b9a-a5ca0e2637b2\", \"body\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\"}"}
```

Now, the final step is to test it to confirm that it works as expected.

## Test your consumer

In the `consumer` directory, run:

```shell
go mod init consumer/m
go mod tidy
go run .
```

In the output, you'll see a log that indicates your consumer handled the event data:

```shell
10:23:57.648 consumerCallback info    got input with id "1a0a960f-f04f-4c41-9b9a-a5ca0e2637b2" and body "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."  application: consumer
```


## Conclusion

That's it! You created your first gosoline message queue consumer.
