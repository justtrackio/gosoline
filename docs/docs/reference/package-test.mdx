title: Package test
---

This package acts as a wrapper over Golang's `testing` module.

## Interfaces

### [Suite](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/blob/9b64c30bc4156d16fb1f2d11930f0b686b5d0113/pkg/test/suite/suite.go#L11)

#### Interface

```go
type TestingSuite interface {
	Env() *env.Environment
	SetEnv(environment *env.Environment)
	SetT(t *testing.T)
	T() *testing.T
	SetupSuite() []Option
}
```

## Functions

### [Run()](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/blob/9b64c30bc4156d16fb1f2d11930f0b686b5d0113/pkg/test/suite/run.go#L30)

#### Parameters

- `t *testing.T`
- `suite TestingSuite`
- `extraOptions ...Option`

#### Description

This is the starting point for a gosoline integration test. This performs the following steps: 

1. Uses reflection to find all test cases declared by a given `TestSuite`.
2. Applies each of the `extraOptions`.
3. Creates a kernel with whatever modules or APIs were declared in the `SetupSuite` and `SetupApiDefinitions`.
4. Runs the tests.

## Configuration
Test components are docker container like wiremock or localstack which support you in your integration tests to mock
your applications infrastructure.

#### Container expiry
All test containers are configured with an automatic expiry time to prevent orphaned containers if tests crash. The default is `5m` (5 minutes). This is configured globally via `test.container_manager.expire_after` and applies to all test containers. You can also use `suite.WithContainerExpireAfter()` to set it programmatically.

#### Image configuration
The used image for a component can be configured on a global and on a per component level. The following configuration
snipped shows a config for two wiremock components. **mockA** gets the image configuration from the global level which is
configured via the key `test.defaults.images.wiremock` and **mockB** has local configuration. With this, **mockA** gets
tag `3.4.0` and **mockB** gets `3.3.0`.

```yaml
test:
  container_manager:
    expire_after: 5m  # applies to all containers
  defaults:
    images:
      wiremock:
        repository: wiremock/wiremock
        tag: 3.4.0
  components:
    wiremock:
      mockA: {}
      mockB:
        image:
          repository: wiremock/wiremock
          tag: 3.3.0
```
