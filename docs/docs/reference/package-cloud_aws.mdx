## The cloud/aws package

## Configuration
The AWS SDK v2 based services use the following default settings for region
and endpoint, meaning you get those values for every requested client if you
don't specify anything else for the client.
```json
cloud:
  aws:
    defaults:
      region: "eu-central-1"
      endpoint: "http://localhost:4566" #localstack
```

### General service config
AWS service clients are created and configured by name. The pattern here is:
```golang
func ProvideClient(ctx context.Context, config cfg.Config, logger log.Logger, name string, optFns ...func(options *awsCfg.LoadOptions) error) (*serviceX.Client, error)
```
The resulting client can be configured by:
```yaml
cloud:
    aws:
        serviceX:
            clients:
                default: # name of the client
                    assume_role: ""
                    backoff:
                        cancel_delay: 0s
                        initial_interval: 50ms
                        max_attempts: 10
                        max_elapsed_time: 10m0s
                        max_interval: 10s
                    credentials:
                        access_key_id: justtrack
                        secret_access_key: justtrack
                        session_token: ""
                    endpoint: http://localhost:4566
                    http_client:
                        timeout: 0s
                    profile: ""
                    region: eu-central-1

```

### Cloudwatch
Call
```golang
import(
    gosoCloudwatch "github.com/justtrackio/gosoline/pkg/cloud/aws/cloudwatch"
)

cloudwatchClient := gosoCloudwatch.ProvideClient(ctx, config, logger , "default")
```
to get the default cloudwatch client. You don't have to provide any config
if you want to go with the default settings. The default settings are:
```yaml
cloud:
    aws:
        cloudwatch:
            clients:
                default:
                    assume_role: ""
                    backoff:
                        cancel_delay: 0s
                        initial_interval: 50ms
                        max_attempts: 10
                        max_elapsed_time: 10m0s
                        max_interval: 10s
                    credentials:
                        access_key_id: justtrack
                        secret_access_key: justtrack
                        session_token: ""
                    endpoint: http://localhost:4566
                    http_client:
                        timeout: 0s
                    profile: ""
                    region: eu-central-1

```
These are the default values which are used if you don't provide any config by yourself.
