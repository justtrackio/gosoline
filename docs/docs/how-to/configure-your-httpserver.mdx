title: Configure your HTTP servers
---

With gosoline, you have flexibility in how you define and run your HTTP servers. In this guide, you'll learn multiple ways to do this, so you can choose the option that best meet your needs.

## Default HTTP Server

To configure and run a single, default HTTP server, configure your server in `config.dist.yml`:

```yml
httpserver:
    default:
        port: 8080  
```

Then, run your server, for example in `main.go`:

```go
application.RunHttpDefaultServer(definer)
```

## Multiple HTTP Servers

To configure and run multiple servers, configure your servers in `config.dist.yml`:

```yml
httpserver:
    public:
        port: 8080
    private:
        port: 8090
```

Then, run your servers with their own definers, for example in `main.go`:

```go
application.RunHttpServers(map[string]httpserver.Definer{
	"public":  publicDefiner,
	"private": privateDefiner,
})
```
