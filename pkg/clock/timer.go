// A Timer will send the current time to a channel after a delay elapsed.

	// If you enabled UTC, the timestamps are converted to UTC before you receive them.
	Chan() <-chan time.Time
	// Reset changes the timer to expire after duration d.
	//
	// For a Timer created with Clock.NewTimer, Reset should be invoked only on stopped or expired timers with drained channels.
	//
	// If a program has already received a value from t.Chan(), the timer is known to have expired and the channel drained, so
	// t.Reset can be used directly. If a program has not yet received a value from t.Chan(), however, the timer must be
	// stopped and—if Stop reports that the timer expired before being stopped—the channel explicitly drained:
	//
	// 	if !t.Stop() {
	// 		<-t.Chan()
	// 	}
	// 	t.Reset(d)
	//
	// This should not be done concurrent to other receives from the Timer's channel.
	//
	// Note that, unlike the time.Timer's Reset method, this one doesn't return a value as it is not possible to use it correctly.
	// If you try to drain the channel after calling Reset, the timer might already expire. Thus, you would drain the value
	// you would afterwards be waiting for. Reset should always be invoked on stopped or expired channels, as described above.
	//
	// A call to Reset is not thread safe. You should only ever have a single go routine responsible for a Timer or have
	// some way to coordinate between different go routines.
	//
	// If you did not drain the channel after resetting a timer and that timer expires a second time, the first value will
	// be dropped and only the second value will be available in the channel for reading.
	Reset(d time.Duration)
	// Stop prevents the Timer from firing. It returns true if the call stops the timer, false if the timer has already
	// expired or been stopped. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a read from the channel succeeding
	// incorrectly.
	//
	// To ensure the channel is empty after a call to Stop, check the return value and drain the channel.
	// For example, assuming the program has not received from t.Chan() already:
	//
	// 	if !t.Stop() {
	// 		<-t.Chan()
	// 	}
	//
	// This cannot be done concurrent to other receives from the Timer's channel or other calls to the Timer's Stop method.
	//
	// A call to Stop is not thread safe. You should only ever have a single go routine responsible for cleaning up a Timer
	// or have some way to coordinate between different go routines.
